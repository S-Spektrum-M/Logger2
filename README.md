# Spektral Logger 2

A simple/extensible(see usage) fast(see benchmarks) logging utility.

## Motivation

This logging project stands out due to its unique advantages over alternatives
like fmtlog, quill, and BinLog. Unlike these frameworks that often necessitate
modifications or additions to your existing classes for integration, this
solution is non-intrusive and requires no adaptation of your codebase, ensuring
seamless implementation without disrupting current workflows. Moreover, it
offers unparalleled versatility by logging any type of information, from simple
messages to complex data structures, making it highly adaptable across various
applications and environments. Additionally, its dual output
capability—supporting both text-based and binary formats—caters to a broader
range of use cases, from human-readable logs for debugging purposes to
machine-readable formats for automated processing and analytics. This
comprehensive feature set positions the logging project as an optimal choice
for developers seeking a flexible and robust logging solution without
compromising on performance or code integrity.
